Gravitas centralizes all your assignments from Quercus and Crowdmark into a single sleek dashboard, automatically filtering out assignments without due dates or those that have already passed. Using AI (Google Gemini), it provides concise summaries, estimated completion times, and clear indicators of difficulty. The due dates automatically are populated into the calendar and is available for export into all calendar apps. The all in one simple, easy-to-use interface.
